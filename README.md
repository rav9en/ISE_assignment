## Narrative Storyboard 
Write a narrative storyboard for the game artefact.  The narrative should revolve around a 
sport match and include character design, movement, and event-driven actions. The 
storyboard should outline the following information. 
• The main characters and their abilities. 
• The environment settings such as arena and background. 
• Plot and mechanics (ex. Seeking fame and fortune then join the racing match) 

## Game Assets
Create the following game assets and integrate it in the final game development. 
• Visual assets should encompass backgrounds, sprites, textures, animation, particle 
effects.  
• Audio Assets should encompass background music and sound effects such as noise, 
character voice or  audio clips.  
• Any other necessary assets to define the event-driven actions / obstacles / terrains and 
game logic. 

## Artefact Implementation
 Setup the game environment using Pygame or Panda3D. 
• Implement the game concepts, logic and mechanics based on the narrative storyboard.  
• Integrate the visual and audio assets in the previous section into the game environment. 
• Apply special effects to enhance attacks or major events in the game. 

## Artefact Demo
The demonstration will assess your knowledge and understanding as well as technical 
skills in the field of imaging and special effect. 

## Submission

folder. 
* Provide a short (2-3 minutes) video demo showcasing the gameplay, narrative, and special effects implemented.

* Introduction which will describe the game and narrative. 
* Storyboard narrative. 
* Screenshot the Game Scene and explains the assets. 
* Explains how the visual and audio special effects were integrated into the game. 
* Conclusion will describe the strength and weakness of the current artefact and possible future enhancement.
